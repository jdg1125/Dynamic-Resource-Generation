This is a prototype for an attack monitoring interface developed in cooperation with AnaVation, LLC. 

An overview describing the motivations for and some of the goals of the project can be found here:

If the link above is broken you can find the same document, named ProjectOverview.pdf, in the repo's root directory, in the Documentation folder. 
Also contained in this folder is the document, RequirementsAnalysis.pdf, which gives a high level overview of the system. 

The system leverages a number of AWS services: CloudWatch, Directory Service, EC2, Lambda, WorkSpaces, and WorkDocs. Our sponsor, AnaVation, LLC, was kind enough to fund our usage of these services for the duration of the project. Without active users, it is not feasible to continue funding this project myself, so the code and documentation here are mostly for demonstrative purposes.
